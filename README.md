# deep-go-wrap
Toolkit designed to make turning your Deep Neural Network model into a standalone Go bot easy.

Planned Features
----------------
 * interface for plugging in various Deep Network architectures, automatic transformation of board to feature planes
    * DeepCL nets, easy to extend
 * full GTP support
 * move correctness checking
 * pass implementation, probably by using GnuGo as an pass-oracle
 * **any other ideas?**
